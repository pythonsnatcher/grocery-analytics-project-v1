# Tuco's Grocery Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains version 1 of the Tableau analytics project for Tuco's grocery store. The project aims to analyze sales data from the past 12 months to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help optimize business strategies and decision-making.

## Tableau Workbook
The main component of this project is the Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) file, which includes visualizations, dashboards, and analysis of the grocery sales data. You can open this file in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader to interact with the visualizations and explore the data.

## Data Source
The raw data used for this analysis is stored in the "tuco_grocery_transactions_last_12_months_version_2.csv" file. This CSV file contains transaction records, including information such as TransactionID, Date, Item, Price, Quantity, Category, and more.

## Additional Files
- **tuco_grocery_transactions_last_12_months_version_2.xlsx**: This Excel file is another version of the grocery sales data, providing an alternative format for viewing and analyzing the data.

- **tucos_lis_part_2_(no_comments).py**: This Python script was used in the data cleaning or preprocessing stage of the analysis. It may contain functions or routines for data manipulation, cleaning, or transformation.
